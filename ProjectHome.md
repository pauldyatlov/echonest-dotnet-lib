C# methods and facilities to access the online echonest.com APIs


i am nerd
i am a C# developer
i am a musician

you see this project is inevitable

the plan is to map all the API

no detailed roadmap is still available yet, but i started from the TrackAPI first, that is the one i was more curious of (upload and analyze roughly works right now).

the development will not be constant, so be patient pls!

feel free to contact me about everything you may ever need
